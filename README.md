## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment with access to system site packages:

    **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    **On Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the project:**
    - Check the `config` file and update any necessary settings according to your environment.
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following structure:
      ```
      FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
      PARENT_DIR="your_dir"
      ```
    You can obtain a free API key by signing up at [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/).

2. **Run the data pipeline manually or with a script:**
    - **Manual steps:**
        1. Run `fetch_prices.py` to download price data:
            ```bash
            python scripts/fetch_prices.py
            ```
        2. Run `fetch_news.py` to collect news articles:
            ```bash
            python scripts/fetch_news.py
            ```
        3. Run `sentiment-analysis.py` to analyze sentiment:
            ```bash
            python scripts/sentiment-analysis.py
            ```
        4. **If you get an error about the config file not being accessible,** open a terminal and run:
            ```bash
            env_setup.bat
            ```
           Then try running the previous command again.
    - **Or run the pipeline script:**
        - On Windows:
            ```bash
            scripts\run_data_pipeline.bat
            ```
        - On Linux/macOS:
            ```bash
            bash scripts/run_data_pipeline.sh
            ```
3. **Open the notebooks and run the implementation:**
    - Make sure your `.venv` environment is activated and selected as the kernel in your Jupyter notebook interface.
    - Open either `notebooks/train_and_test_portfolio.ipynb` or `notebooks/train_and_test_single_stock.ipynb` to run the implementation and experiments.

Refer to the individual script or notebook documentation for more details on usage.
